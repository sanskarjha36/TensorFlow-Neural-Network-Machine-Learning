# TensorFlow-Neural-Network-Machine-Learning


Goal:
To Use Google TensorFlow to learn neural network-based machine learning in Python.

Technology:
Python, TensorFlow, IPython, Jupyter Notebooks, Numpy, Pandas, MatplotLib, Seaborn

Specifics:
Python 3, TensorFlow 2

Description:
The goal of this project is to explore two machine learning problems:
• Part 1 is to replace the MNIST image data with a harder set of letter representation data and train a good model for it.
• Part 2 is to create and develop a model for data loaded from a CSV file about Canadian Football League draft/combine data.
